# Hi, I am Brandon
The capstone project I am working on is Engineering Simulations with Game Development Tools.

## The goal of the project
The project aims to create a simulation of an autonomous vehicle built using the Bevy game engine in Rust. The simulation includes lane detection, decision-making systems, and real-time input handling.

## Features
- Custom-built vehicle physics using a rigid-body engine.
- Real-time input system for autonomous and manual control.
- Terrain-aware line drawing to define driving paths.
- Weather effects and a day-night lighting system.

## Technologies Used
- Rust
- Python
- Bevy Engine
- WebSockets (for external input)

## My Role
- Created weather effect in Bevy game engine.
- Develop a first-person camera for testing.
- Refactored and documented skeleton code for team use.
- Integrated real-time line drawing tools
- Created a line detection tool and a basic lane-following system.
